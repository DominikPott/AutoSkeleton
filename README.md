# Auto Skeleton Tools for Houdini
![use case example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Sense/AutoSkeleton/main/sauce_skeleton.JPG)
As part of the EU [SAUCE](https://www.sauceproject.eu/) Project, the [V-SENSE](https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/) lab of [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie) developed auto-skeleton tools that can be used to quickly create skeletal structures from human character meshes in the [Houdini 3D animation software](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/).
-	The tool can extract a skeleton from a human character mesh in any pose if the rest pose of the same character is provided.
-	The generated skeleton works seamlessly with the newly introduced [KineFX](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/character/kinefx/index.html) workflow inside [Houdini 18.5](https://youtu.be/mcDm_irEKb0?t=798) or later.
-	The skeletal structure is also compatible with the CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture [Database](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu).

To use these tools, simply copy the hda files to your local otls directory.
